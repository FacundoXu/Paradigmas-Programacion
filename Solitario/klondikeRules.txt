Tableu)
*After shuffling, a tableau of seven fanned piles of cards
is laid from left to right. From left to right, each pile contains
one more card than the last. The topmost card of each pile
is turned face up.
*The tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors.
*Every face-up card in a partial pile, or a complete pile,
can be moved, as a unit, to another tableau pile on the
basis of its highest card.
Any empty piles can be filled with a King,
or a pile of cards with a King.


Stock)
*The remaining cards form the stock and are placed
facedown at the upper left of the layout.
*Turning one card at a time to the waste,
with three passes through the deck.


Foundations)
*The four foundations are built
up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King
