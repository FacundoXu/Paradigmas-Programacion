Cards) RED: DIAMONDS HEARTS
       BLACK: CLUBS SPADES

The main purpose of the game is to remove all cards from the table,
assembling them in the tableau before removing them.[4] Initially,
54 cards are dealt to the tableau in ten piles, face down except for the top cards.
The tableau piles build down by rank, and in-suit sequences can be moved together.
The 50 remaining cards can be dealt to the tableau ten at a time when none of the piles are empty.

A typical Spider layout requires the use of two decks.
The Tableau consists of 10 stacks, with 6 cards in the first 4 stacks,
with the 6th card face up, and 5 cards in the remaining 6 stacks,
with the 5th card face up.
Each time the stock is used it deals out one card to each stack.
